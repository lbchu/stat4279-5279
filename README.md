**Course Description:** Introduction to modern statistical computing in R as a core component of statistical practice. Topics include statistically oriented programming in, data structures and algorithmic programming concepts, data management and verification, and reproducible workflows. Students learn to implement and debug code for simulation studies, resampling methods, and statistical modeling, and to use computation to support data analysis and graphical exploration. Emphasis is placed on software reliability, code organization, and the translation of statistical ideas into computational procedures. Additional topics may include machine learning methods and interfacing with external data sources and software packages.  Graduation Restriction: May not be used for graduate credit in the Statistics MS and PhD degree programs.

## Repository purpose

This repository is used to:
- version-control course materials,
- host rendered lecture slides via GitHub Pages,
- support reproducible generation of HTML outputs from R Markdown.

Students should access materials through the **Canvas** for most up-to-date material, not by browsing this repository directly.
